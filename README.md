# Livygo Project started!

Ever since Duolingo closing their doors on their Incubator Program and Forum and so on, a lot of people have becoming really unsastified on what Duolingo have become, especially the recent "revolt" and endorsement of Lingonaut Project by r/Duolingo mods. For everyone's information, I have been a loyal ( still loyal ) Duolingo user for 3 years long with 1093 day streak ( as of February 17 2025 ) and I do agree some of the disadvantages of using Duolingo ( health system, lacks of grammar lessons ).

But really, what will happen if you have two identical centralized language-teaching app? One being closed, and other being open. For the smarts, they will choose whatever they think it fit their needs; For less savvy people, they choose whatever it exposed to social media the most.

Now I am in no relations or affiliation with both of them, Duolingo and Lingonaut, and I'm supposedly an ordinary Duolingo user who will take like 5 minutes on their lessons and move on on my life. However, seeing that much dissatification and the needs of *usable* completely-free language-teaching app. Using the power of AI tools and mine, I guess I will create one from scratch and see how the program will goes even though there is Lingonaut Project already. 

Oh, by the way here's Livy as the mascot of Livygo. Both mascot, UI design and codebase is very very very early phase.

## Disclaimer 

Yes I know. Some people hate AI tools with a passion especially when they are using a language-teaching application. The concerns like mispronunciation and low quality teaching content are legitimate and I am NOT going to deny that. Despite massive usage of AI in this project, I open my doors to those who want to help this project voluntarily or pull requests. And also, I did not ask for your opinions on using AI instead of real programmer and your argument of "AI replacing human's jobs". Sure I should have code myself or another person to do code, and sure it could probably replace some jobs. But this only limited to repetitive jobs and even then it still need human supervision.

This topic have been discussed for who-knows-how-many times, and if you just don't like how grey is Deepseek or AI in general, just don't use this and move on to better alternative like Lingodeer or Anki.
