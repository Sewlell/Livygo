<h2>Look I have never learn Spanish before. I write this guide with the guidance of multiples source. Please take this Guidebook with a pitch of salt.</h2>

Welcome to your journey learning Spanish (European). This is a course aiming for Spanish CEFR A1-B1 but please expect less because it's gonna be lacking in content here and there.

In this chapter, you will learn about the sentence structure of Spanish.

For starters, Spanish follow SVO orders, which is the same as English. What is SVO you ask? it is "Subject __Verb__ Object". Here's an couple of examples demonstrate the SVO order in both language :

>   Yo **leo** un libro.<br>
>   *I **read** a book*

>
>

Like English, you got a Subject, a Verb, and an Object to form an entire sentence.

Obviously, you don't talk or write Spanish just in a simple affirmative sentence. So how do you make a negative sentences? Simple, you add a "no" before the verb.

>   Yo no **leo** un libro.<br>
>   *I do not **read** a book*

>   No **tenemos** tiempo.<br>
>   *(We) don't **have** time*

Now, now we can make a negation. How do we make a yes/no questions?
