<h2>Look I have never learn Spanish before. I write this guide with the guidance of multiples source. Please take this Guidebook with a pitch of salt.</h2>

First, you got the *infinitive*. In English, it's usually came along with **to** like the following example:

>   to be -> I am<br>
>   to speak -> She speaks<br>
>   to eat -> He eats

In Spanish, you don't get the **to** but instead, you got suffixes **-ar, -er, -ir**. For example :

>   ser/estar -> to be<br>
>   cortar -> to cut<br>
>   vivir -> to live

In order to make conjugations, you need to throw these suffixes into the bin, and add an apprioriate ending.

Before we move on to how you supposed to make conjugations with those infinitive. I have to show you where infinitive words in Spanish can be used of.

One, you can use it as a **subject** like English.

> **Vivir** en una ciudad grande es emocionante.<br>
> ***Living** in a big city is exciting.*

Two, you use it **after a verb**, these are usually modal verbs.

> Necesito **cortar** mi cabello.<br>
> *I need **to cut** my hair.*

Three, you use it **after preposition**

> Antes de **vivir** aqu√≠, estaba en otra ciudad.<br>
> *Before **living** here, I was in another city.*

> Voy a **cortar** el pastel ahora.<br>
> *I'm going **to cut** the cake now.*

A little fun fact, you may realize that English prefer a lot of gerund (verbs with -ing that turned into a noun like the word **living** example above, for non-linguistics folks), while Spanish prefer infinitives.
